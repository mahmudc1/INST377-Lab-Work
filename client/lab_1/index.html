            <h2>Let's try some Inline Elements</h2>
            <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something,</em>in a line of text</p>
            <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em></p>
            <h3><p>My name is Mahmud Cole. Born and raised in Baltimore Maryland,
                I am a senior persuing a degree in Government and Information Sciences,
            I love music and playing the piano, these are things I value more than just about anything,
        excluding my family. I am <em>excited for this course!</em> and for this year.</p></h3>
        <p>Soft line breaks cab't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
        <p>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some sort of line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
